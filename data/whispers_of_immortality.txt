\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 Webster was much possessed by death\
     And saw the skull beneath the skin;\
     And breastless creatures under ground\
     Leaned backward with a lipless grin.\
\
     Daffodil bulbs instead of balls\
     Stared from the sockets of the eyes!\
     He knew that thought clings round dead limbs\
     Tightening its lusts and luxuries.\
\
     Donne, I suppose, was such another\
     Who found no substitute for sense;\
     To seize and clutch and penetrate,\
     Expert beyond experience,\
\
     He knew the anguish of the marrow\
     The ague of the skeleton;\
     No contact possible to flesh\
     Allayed the fever of the bone.\
\
     Grishkin is nice: her Russian eye\
     Is underlined for emphasis;\
     Uncorseted, her friendly bust\
     Gives promise of pneumatic bliss.\
\
     The couched Brazilian jaguar\
     Compels the scampering marmoset\
     With subtle effluence of cat;\
     Grishkin has a maisonette;\
\
     The sleek Brazilian jaguar\
     Does not in its arboreal gloom\
     Distil so rank a feline smell\
     As Grishkin in a drawing-room.\
\
     And even the Abstract Entities\
     Circumambulate her charm;\
     But our lot crawls between dry ribs\
     To keep our metaphysics warm.\
